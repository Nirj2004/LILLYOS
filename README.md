Free time project to create lightweight and simple OS for smartwatch, with only necessary small functionality (to keep it simple and effective). With strong DIY cyberpunk motivation (don't want to support and pay money to big corporations). And with cool 80' cyberpunk retro design!

## Installation

 - download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode) (or any other C/C++ IDE)
    - (use complex IDE; this project is too large fro Arduino IDE)
 - ~~clone~~ download this repository
 - add [TTGO library](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/TTGO_TWatch_Library) to the project, following instructions in library's readme
 - connect [LillyGo T_Watch device](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50053&Id=1380&FId=t3:50053:3) via USB
